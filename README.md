# Procedures in Visual Basic
by Michael Randazzo

-----

### General Overview
This unit will be the unit directly following units that cover how to use variables, conditionals and loops in an Intro to Computer Science class. This unit will not introduce new topics but will rather allow students to create projects that will make use of each of those objects and studctures in different combinations. Due to the event driven design of Visual Basic. The projects students will create will be intended for user interaction.

### Motivation for Unit
The motivaiton for this unit is to create a reason for students to use and develop a deeper understanding of each of the main data structures covered earlier. A core concept for an intro to cs class is to given students foundational knowledge of loops and conditionals and the best way to develop that understanding is to use those topics to create something. This unit really allows students to solve complex problems on their own or in small groups by developing a process. Time will be spent first break down the elements of the assignment into a few sections and developing pseudocode and then finally making the project. The projects will also allow students to see what loops and conditionals can do based on the user based project design.
